h1. What is git-bisect?

git-bisect is a command tool to help finding commits that change a good state.

h2. How to use git-bisect?

This example uses git bisect in conjunction with _phpunit_ to check when the testsuite breaks.

h3. Define the "good" state

To define the "good" state, we choose _phpunit_. This is the testsuite run. If it fails, the commits state is "bad".

h3. Set up

The following commands will start the actual work with git-bisect.

* git bisect start
* git bisect bad

This will start the bisect search and mark the current version as "bad".

h3. Knowing the good version

* git bisect good SHA1

This will mark the last known "good" state on the commit hash SHA1.

h3. Automate it!

* git bisect run ./bisect-phpunit.sh

This will issue bisect to use the _phpunit_ command line to check for a good state for each commit.
The script will wrap the exit codes of phpunit to the correct ones to operate with git-bisect.

h2. Try-it Out

Using this project you can use these commands to actually test it.

* git bisect start
* git bisect bad #ABadCommitSha (HEAD is bad, so we can leave it out)
* git bisect good 0fef4d40fec8ba1d1de73d8f13739e6c890e2223
* git bisect run ./bisect-phpunit.sh

The result will be this commit:b27af3d6ff6da22e02850d6e61d966db438847d7.
